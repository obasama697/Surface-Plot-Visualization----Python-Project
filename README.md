# Surface Plot Visualization Project in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates the generation and visualization of surface plots using Python. It explores the creation of 3D surface plots to visually represent data landscapes and functions with the help of essential Python libraries such as Matplotlib and NumPy.

## Purpose
The main objective of this notebook is to create visually appealing 3D surface plots that help in understanding complex data distributions and mathematical functions through graphical representation.

## Key Features
- Importing necessary libraries for plotting and numerical computation.
- Creating 3D axes with Matplotlib's `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`.
- Generating data points using NumPy meshgrid functions.
- Plotting 3D surfaces with customization options including colormap and labels.
- Displaying plots interactively.

## Libraries Used
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`
- `numpy`

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook to generate and display the 3D surface plots. Customize the function and parameters within the notebook to create different surface visualizations tailored to specific data or functions.
